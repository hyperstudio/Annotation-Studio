<p>For the purposes of the Agreement, the term “document” refers to any material uploaded by the user into Annotation Studio, including, but not limited to text files, video files, image files, and audio files.  For the purposes of the Agreement, the term “annotation” refers to any comment made by the user in the Application on the document, which may or may not include text, video, images, or audio.</p>

<p>Please read this Agreement carefully before accessing or using Annotation Studio. By accessing or using any part of Annotation Studio, you agree to become bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

<p>1. Your Annotation Studio account</p>

<p>If you create an account on Annotation Studio, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with the account.</p>

<p>If you choose a password or any other piece of information as part of our security procedures, you must take reasonable steps to keep such information confidential and secure, and you must not disclose it to any third party. We have the right to disable any account or password if, in our reasonable opinion, your account information has been compromised. You must tell us immediately if you become aware of or suspect any unauthorized use of your account or access to your password.</p>

<p>You must not upload documents to your account or annotate in a misleading or unlawful manner, including in a manner intended to trade on the name or reputation of others.  We may change or remove any document or annotation that we consider inappropriate or unlawful, or otherwise likely to cause MIT/HyperStudio liability. You must immediately notify MIT/HyperStudio of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of security. MIT/HyperStudio will not be liable for any acts or omissions by You, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.</p>

<p>2. Responsibility of Contributors</p>

<p>If you operate an account, annotate a document, upload a document, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available by means of the Application (any such material, and annotation data, including but not limited to annotations, timestamps, locations within the text, tags, links, and images, collectively, “Content”), you are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content. That is the case regardless of whether the Content in question constitutes text, graphics, an audio file, or video file. By making Content available, you represent and warrant that:</p>

<ul>
<li>the uploading, downloading, copying and use of the Content will not infringe the proprietary rights, including but not limited to the copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret rights, of any third party;</li>
<li>if your employer has rights to intellectual property you create, you have either (i) received permission from your employer to post or make available the Content, including but not limited to any software, or (ii) secured from your employer a waiver as to all rights in or to the Content;</li>
<li>you have fully complied with any third-party licenses relating to the Content, and have done all things necessary to successfully pass through to end users any required terms;</li>
<li>the Content does not contain or install any viruses, worms, malware, Trojan horses or other harmful or destructive content;</li>
<li>the Content is not spam, is not machine- or randomly-generated, and does not contain unethical or unwanted commercial content;</li>
<li>the Content is not pornographic, does not contain threats or incite violence, and does not violate the privacy or publicity rights of any third party;</li>
<li>your account is not named in a manner that misleads your readers into thinking that you are another person. For example, the name of your account or any class/working groups is not the name of a person other than yourself; and</li>
<li>you have, in the case of Content that includes computer code, accurately categorized and/or described the type, nature, uses and effects of the materials, whether requested to do so by MIT/HyperStudio or otherwise.</li>
</ul>

<p>By submitting Content to Annotation Studio, you grant MIT/HyperStudio a world-wide, perpetual, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, modify, research, analyze, adapt and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing, improving and promoting Annotation Studio, MIT, and HyperStudio. MIT/HyperStudio will remove personally identifiable information (PII) from all Content which it uses hereunder.</p>

<p>If you delete Content, MIT/HyperStudio will use reasonable efforts to remove it from the Application. You acknowledge that caching of, or references to, the Content may not be immediately removed.</p>

<p>Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, MIT/HyperStudio has the right (though not the obligation) to, in MIT/HyperStudio’s sole discretion, (i) refuse or remove any content that, in MIT/HyperStudio’s reasonable opinion, violates any MIT/HyperStudio policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (ii) terminate or deny access to and use of the Application to any individual or entity for any reason,.</p>

<p>3. Responsibility of Application Visitors</p>

<p>MIT/HyperStudio has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the Content, including computer software, uploaded or posted to Annotation Studio, and cannot therefore be responsible for that material’s content, use or effects. By operating the Application, MIT/HyperStudio does not represent or imply that it endorses the Content there posted, or that it believes such Content to be accurate, useful or non-harmful. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. The Application may contain content that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable, as well as content containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and other errors. The Application may also contain material that violates the privacy or publicity rights, or infringes the intellectual property and other proprietary rights, of third parties, or the downloading, copying or use of which is subject to additional terms and conditions, stated or unstated. MIT/HyperStudio disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from the use by users of the Application, or from any downloading by those users of Content there posted.</p>

<p>4. Copyright Infringement and MIT DMCA Policy</p>

<p>As MIT/HyperStudio asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that Content on Annotation Studio violates your copyright, you are encouraged to notify MIT/HyperStudio in accordance with MIT’s Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) policy (http://web.mit.edu/copyright/policy.html). MIT/HyperStudio will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the applicable Content. MIT/HyperStudio will terminate a user’s access to and use of the Application if, under appropriate circumstances, the user is determined to be a repeat infringer of the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of MIT/HyperStudio or others.</p>

<p>5. Intellectual Property</p>
