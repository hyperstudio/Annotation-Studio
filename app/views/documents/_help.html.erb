	<h4>Annotating</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>On any document page, if the document's status is <strong>Published</strong>, you can select text from the document and you’ll see an annotate button appear.</li>
		<li>Click the button to see the annotation editor.</li>
		<li>Enter your comment and any tags you’d like to save with the annotation, as well as whether you would like your groups to be able to view the annotation.</li>
		<li>Click save, and you will see both a highlight in the text, and an annotation in the right hand sidebar list.</li>
		<li>Roll over the highlight to see the annotation viewer.</li>
		<li>Click the edit button on the top right of the viewer to edit the annotation.</li>
		<li>Make your edits and click save to save them.</li>
        <li>If a document's status is <strong>Draft</strong>, it may not be annotated until it is published. If a document's status is <strong>Archived</strong>, annotations are read-only.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Privacy</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>The right hand sidebar allows you to filter annotations from yourself, your groups, or your entire class.</li>
		<li>In private instances of the application, more nuanced permissions schemes are supported</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
	<ul>
