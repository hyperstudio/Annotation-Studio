half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting
people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, ('which certainly
was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label,
with the words 'DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters. 

It was all very well to say 'Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not going to do THAT
in a hurry. 'No, I'll look first,' she said, 'and see whether it's marked
""poison"" or not'; for she had read several nice little histories about children
who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because
they WOULD not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a
red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger VERY
deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink
much from a bottle marked 'poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or
later. 

However, this bottle was NOT marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding
it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard,
pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.

high chest, standing back in a deep recess on one side of the fireplace.

The sight of it made her start; and, forgetting everything else, she

stood gazing on it in motionless wonder, while these thoughts crossed

her:





""This is strange indeed! I did not expect such a sight as this! An

immense heavy chest! What can it hold? Why should it be placed here?

Pushed back too, as if meant to be out of sight! I will look into

it—cost me what it may, I will look into it—and directly too—by

daylight. If I stay till evening my candle may go out."" She advanced and

examined it closely: it was of cedar, curiously inlaid with some darker

wood, and raised, about a foot from the ground, on a carved stand of the

same. The lock was silver, though tarnished from age; at each end

were the imperfect remains of handles also of silver, broken perhaps

prematurely by some strange violence; and, on the centre of the lid, was

a mysterious cipher, in the same metal. Catherine bent over it intently,

but without being able to distinguish anything with certainty. She could

not, in whatever direction she took it, believe the last letter to be

a T; and yet that it should be anything else in that house was

a circumstance to raise no common degree of astonishment. If not

originally theirs, by what strange events could it have fallen into the

Tilney family?





Her fearful curiosity was every moment growing greater; and seizing,

with trembling hands, the hasp of the lock, she resolved at all hazards

to satisfy herself at least as to its contents. With difficulty, for

something seemed to resist her efforts, she raised the lid a few inches;

but at that moment a sudden knocking at the door of the room made her,

starting, quit her hold, and the lid closed with alarming violence. This

ill-timed intruder was Miss Tilney's maid, sent by her mistress to be of

use to Miss Morland; and though Catherine immediately dismissed her, it

recalled her to the sense of what she ought to be doing, and forced her,

in spite of her anxious desire to penetrate this mystery, to proceed in

her dressing without further delay. Her progress was not quick, for her

thoughts and her eyes were still bent on the object so well calculated

to interest and alarm; and though she dared not waste a moment upon

a second attempt, she could not remain many paces from the chest. At

length, however, having slipped one arm into her gown, her toilette

seemed so nearly finished that the impatience of her curiosity might

safely be indulged. One moment surely might be spared; and, so desperate

should be the exertion of her strength, that, unless secured by

supernatural means, the lid in one moment should be thrown back. With

this spirit she sprang forward, and her confidence did not deceive her.

Her resolute effort threw back the lid, and gave to her astonished eyes

the injustice of your suspicions. Here was I, in my eagerness to get on,

refusing to wait only five minutes for my sister, breaking the promise

I had made of reading it aloud, and keeping her in suspense at a most

interesting part, by running away with the volume, which, you are to

observe, was her own, particularly her own. I am proud when I reflect on

it, and I think it must establish me in your good opinion.""

""Oh! yes—I do not think I should be easily frightened, because there

would be so many people in the house—and besides, it has never been

uninhabited and left deserted for years, and then the family come back

to it unawares, without giving any notice, as generally happens.""





""No, certainly. We shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimly

lighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire—nor be obliged to spread

our beds on the floor of a room without windows, doors, or furniture.

But you must be aware that when a young lady is (by whatever means)

introduced into a dwelling of this kind, she is always lodged apart from

the rest of the family. While they snugly repair to their own end of the

house, she is formally conducted by Dorothy, the ancient housekeeper, up

a different staircase, and along many gloomy passages, into an apartment

never used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty years

before. Can you stand such a ceremony as this? Will not your mind

misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber—too lofty and

extensive for you, with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take

in its size—its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as

life, and the bed, of dark green stuff or purple velvet, presenting even

a funereal appearance? Will not your heart sink within you?""





""Oh! But this will not happen to me, I am sure.""





""How fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment! And

what will you discern? Not tables, toilettes, wardrobes, or drawers,

but on one side perhaps the remains of a broken lute, on the other a

ponderous chest which no efforts can open, and over the fireplace

the portrait of some handsome warrior, whose features will so

incomprehensibly strike you, that you will not be able to withdraw your

eyes from it. Dorothy, meanwhile, no less struck by your appearance,

gazes on you in great agitation, and drops a few unintelligible hints.

To raise your spirits, moreover, she gives you reason to suppose that

the part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly haunted, and informs

you that you will not have a single domestic within call. With this

parting cordial she curtsies off—you listen to the sound of her

receding footsteps as long as the last echo can reach you—and when,

with fainting spirits, you attempt to fasten your door, you discover,

with increased alarm, that it has no lock.""





""Oh! Mr. Tilney, how frightful! This is just like a book! But it cannot

really happen to me. I am sure your housekeeper is not really Dorothy.

Well, what then?""





""Nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the first night. After

surmounting your unconquerable horror of the bed, you will retire to

rest, and get a few hours' unquiet slumber. But on the second, or at

farthest the third night after your arrival, you will probably have a

violent storm. Peals of thunder so loud as to seem to shake the edifice

to its foundation will roll round the neighbouring mountains—and during

the frightful gusts of wind which accompany it, you will probably think

you discern (for your lamp is not extinguished) one part of the hanging

more violently agitated than the rest. Unable of course to repress your

curiosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it, you will instantly

arise, and throwing your dressing-gown around you, proceed to examine

this mystery. After a very short search, you will discover a division in

the tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy the minutest inspection,

and on opening it, a door will immediately appear—which door, being

only secured by massy bars and a padlock, you will, after a few efforts,

succeed in opening—and, with your lamp in your hand, will pass through

it into a small vaulted room.""





""No, indeed; I should be too much frightened to do any such thing.""





""What! Not when Dorothy has given you to understand that there is a

secret subterraneous communication between your apartment and the chapel

of St. Anthony, scarcely two miles off? Could you shrink from so simple

an adventure? No, no, you will proceed into this small vaulted room,

and through this into several others, without perceiving anything very

remarkable in either. In one perhaps there may be a dagger, in another

a few drops of blood, and in a third the remains of some instrument of

torture; but there being nothing in all this out of the common way,

and your lamp being nearly exhausted, you will return towards your own

apartment. In repassing through the small vaulted room, however, your

eyes will be attracted towards a large, old-fashioned cabinet of ebony

and gold, which, though narrowly examining the furniture before, you

had passed unnoticed. Impelled by an irresistible presentiment, you will

eagerly advance to it, unlock its folding doors, and search into

every drawer—but for some time without discovering anything of

importance—perhaps nothing but a considerable hoard of diamonds. At

last, however, by touching a secret spring, an inner compartment will

open—a roll of paper appears—you seize it—it contains many sheets of

manuscript—you hasten with the precious treasure into your own chamber,

but scarcely have you been able to decipher 'Oh! Thou—whomsoever thou

mayst be, into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched Matilda may

fall'—when your lamp suddenly expires in the socket, and leaves you in

total darkness.""





""Oh! No, no—do not say so. Well, go on.""





But Henry was too much amused by the interest he had raised to be able

to carry it farther; he could no longer command solemnity either of

subject or voice, and was obliged to entreat her to use her own fancy

in the perusal of Matilda's woes. Catherine, recollecting herself, grew

ashamed of her eagerness, and began earnestly to assure him that her

attention had been fixed without the smallest apprehension of really

meeting with what he related. ""Miss Tilney, she was sure, would never

put her into such a chamber as he had described! She was not at all

afraid.""





As they drew near the end of their journey, her impatience for a sight

of the abbey—for some time suspended by his conversation on subjects

very different—returned in full force, and every bend in the road was

expected with solemn awe to afford a glimpse of its massy walls of grey

stone, rising amidst a grove of ancient oaks, with the last beams of the

sun playing in beautiful splendour on its high Gothic windows. But so

low did the building stand, that she found herself passing through the

great gates of the lodge into the very grounds of Northanger, without

having discerned even an antique chimney."

high chest, standing back in a deep recess on one side of the fireplace.

The sight of it made her start; and, forgetting everything else, she

stood gazing on it in motionless wonder, while these thoughts crossed

her:





""This is strange indeed! I did not expect such a sight as this! An

immense heavy chest! What can it hold? Why should it be placed here?

Pushed back too, as if meant to be out of sight! I will look into

it—cost me what it may, I will look into it—and directly too—by

daylight. If I stay till evening my candle may go out."" She advanced and

examined it closely: it was of cedar, curiously inlaid with some darker

wood, and raised, about a foot from the ground, on a carved stand of the

same. The lock was silver, though tarnished from age; at each end

were the imperfect remains of handles also of silver, broken perhaps

prematurely by some strange violence; and, on the centre of the lid, was

a mysterious cipher, in the same metal. Catherine bent over it intently,

but without being able to distinguish anything with certainty. She could

not, in whatever direction she took it, believe the last letter to be

a T; and yet that it should be anything else in that house was

a circumstance to raise no common degree of astonishment. If not

originally theirs, by what strange events could it have fallen into the

Tilney family?





Her fearful curiosity was every moment growing greater; and seizing,

with trembling hands, the hasp of the lock, she resolved at all hazards

to satisfy herself at least as to its contents. With difficulty, for

something seemed to resist her efforts, she raised the lid a few inches;

but at that moment a sudden knocking at the door of the room made her,

starting, quit her hold, and the lid closed with alarming violence. This

ill-timed intruder was Miss Tilney's maid, sent by her mistress to be of

use to Miss Morland; and though Catherine immediately dismissed her, it

recalled her to the sense of what she ought to be doing, and forced her,

in spite of her anxious desire to penetrate this mystery, to proceed in

her dressing without further delay. Her progress was not quick, for her

thoughts and her eyes were still bent on the object so well calculated

to interest and alarm; and though she dared not waste a moment upon

a second attempt, she could not remain many paces from the chest. At

length, however, having slipped one arm into her gown, her toilette

seemed so nearly finished that the impatience of her curiosity might

safely be indulged. One moment surely might be spared; and, so desperate

should be the exertion of her strength, that, unless secured by

supernatural means, the lid in one moment should be thrown back. With

this spirit she sprang forward, and her confidence did not deceive her.

Her resolute effort threw back the lid, and gave to her astonished eyes

the view of a white cotton counterpane, properly folded, reposing at one

end of the chest in undisputed possession!





She was gazing on it with the first blush of surprise when Miss Tilney,

anxious for her friend's being ready, entered the room, and to the

rising shame of having harboured for some minutes an absurd expectation,

was then added the shame of being caught in so idle a search. ""That is

a curious old chest, is not it?"" said Miss Tilney, as Catherine hastily

closed it and turned away to the glass. ""It is impossible to say how

many generations it has been here. How it came to be first put in this

room I know not, but I have not had it moved, because I thought it might

sometimes be of use in holding hats and bonnets. The worst of it is that

its weight makes it difficult to open. In that corner, however, it is at

least out of the way."""

appearance of a high, old-fashioned black cabinet, which, though in

a situation conspicuous enough, had never caught her notice before.

Henry's words, his description of the ebony cabinet which was to escape

her observation at first, immediately rushed across her; and though

there could be nothing really in it, there was something whimsical, it

was certainly a very remarkable coincidence! She took her candle and

looked closely at the cabinet. It was not absolutely ebony and gold; but

it was japan, black and yellow japan of the handsomest kind; and as she

held her candle, the yellow had very much the effect of gold. The key

was in the door, and she had a strange fancy to look into it; not,

however, with the smallest expectation of finding anything, but it was

so very odd, after what Henry had said. In short, she could not sleep

till she had examined it. So, placing the candle with great caution on

a chair, she seized the key with a very tremulous hand and tried to turn

it; but it resisted her utmost strength. Alarmed, but not discouraged,

she tried it another way; a bolt flew, and she believed herself

successful; but how strangely mysterious! The door was still immovable.

She paused a moment in breathless wonder. The wind roared down the

chimney, the rain beat in torrents against the windows, and everything

seemed to speak the awfulness of her situation. To retire to bed,

however, unsatisfied on such a point, would be vain, since sleep must be

impossible with the consciousness of a cabinet so mysteriously closed

in her immediate vicinity. Again, therefore, she applied herself to the

key, and after moving it in every possible way for some instants with

the determined celerity of hope's last effort, the door suddenly yielded

to her hand: her heart leaped with exultation at such a victory, and

having thrown open each folding door, the second being secured only by

bolts of less wonderful construction than the lock, though in that her

eye could not discern anything unusual, a double range of small drawers

appeared in view, with some larger drawers above and below them; and in

the centre, a small door, closed also with a lock and key, secured in

all probability a cavity of importance.





Catherine's heart beat quick, but her courage did not fail her. With a

cheek flushed by hope, and an eye straining with curiosity, her fingers

grasped the handle of a drawer and drew it forth. It was entirely empty.

With less alarm and greater eagerness she seized a second, a third, a

fourth; each was equally empty. Not one was left unsearched, and in not

one was anything found. Well read in the art of concealing a treasure,

the possibility of false linings to the drawers did not escape her, and

she felt round each with anxious acuteness in vain. The place in the

middle alone remained now unexplored; and though she had ""never from

the first had the smallest idea of finding anything in any part of the

cabinet, and was not in the least disappointed at her ill success thus

far, it would be foolish not to examine it thoroughly while she was

about it."" It was some time however before she could unfasten the door,

the same difficulty occurring in the management of this inner lock as of

the outer; but at length it did open; and not vain, as hitherto, was her

search; her quick eyes directly fell on a roll of paper pushed back

into the further part of the cavity, apparently for concealment, and

her feelings at that moment were indescribable. Her heart fluttered, her

knees trembled, and her cheeks grew pale. She seized, with an unsteady

hand, the precious manuscript, for half a glance sufficed to ascertain

written characters; and while she acknowledged with awful sensations

this striking exemplification of what Henry had foretold, resolved

instantly to peruse every line before she attempted to rest.





The dimness of the light her candle emitted made her turn to it with

alarm; but there was no danger of its sudden extinction; it had yet some

hours to burn; and that she might not have any greater difficulty in

distinguishing the writing than what its ancient date might occasion,

she hastily snuffed it. Alas! It was snuffed and extinguished in one. A

lamp could not have expired with more awful effect. Catherine, for a

few moments, was motionless with horror. It was done completely; not a

remnant of light in the wick could give hope to the rekindling breath.

Darkness impenetrable and immovable filled the room. A violent gust

of wind, rising with sudden fury, added fresh horror to the moment.

Catherine trembled from head to foot. In the pause which succeeded, a

sound like receding footsteps and the closing of a distant door struck

on her affrighted ear. Human nature could support no more. A cold sweat

stood on her forehead, the manuscript fell from her hand, and groping

her way to the bed, she jumped hastily in, and sought some suspension of

agony by creeping far underneath the clothes. To close her eyes in

sleep that night, she felt must be entirely out of the question. With

a curiosity so justly awakened, and feelings in every way so agitated,

repose must be absolutely impossible. The storm too abroad so dreadful!

She had not been used to feel alarm from wind, but now every blast

seemed fraught with awful intelligence. The manuscript so wonderfully

found, so wonderfully accomplishing the morning's prediction, how was it

to be accounted for? What could it contain? To whom could it relate?

By what means could it have been so long concealed? And how singularly

strange that it should fall to her lot to discover it! Till she had made

herself mistress of its contents, however, she could have neither repose

nor comfort; and with the sun's first rays she was determined to peruse

it. But many were the tedious hours which must yet intervene. She

shuddered, tossed about in her bed, and envied every quiet sleeper. The

storm still raged, and various were the noises, more terrific even

than the wind, which struck at intervals on her startled ear. The very

curtains of her bed seemed at one moment in motion, and at another

the lock of her door was agitated, as if by the attempt of somebody to

enter. Hollow murmurs seemed to creep along the gallery, and more than

once her blood was chilled by the sound of distant moans. Hour after

hour passed away, and the wearied Catherine had heard three proclaimed

by all the clocks in the house before the tempest subsided or she

unknowingly fell fast asleep."

less than she had supposed it to be at first.





Her greedy eye glanced rapidly over a page. She started at its import.

Could it be possible, or did not her senses play her false? An inventory

of linen, in coarse and modern characters, seemed all that was before

her! If the evidence of sight might be trusted, she held a washing-bill

in her hand. She seized another sheet, and saw the same articles with

little variation; a third, a fourth, and a fifth presented nothing

new. Shirts, stockings, cravats, and waistcoats faced her in each. Two

others, penned by the same hand, marked an expenditure scarcely more

interesting, in letters, hair-powder, shoe-string, and breeches-ball.

And the larger sheet, which had enclosed the rest, seemed by its first

cramp line, ""To poultice chestnut mare""—a farrier's bill!"

			merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came
			the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it

I wonder why Austen included this?  Also wonder if the narrator is supposed to be Austen?  This got me curious on when novels first came about.  Apparently only in the 18th century. http://www.nvcc.edu/home/ataormina/novels/history/origins.htm","es, novels; for I will not

adopt that ungenerous and impolitic custom so common with novel-writers,

of degrading by their contemptuous censure the very performances, to the

number of which they are themselves adding—joining with their greatest

enemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such works, and scarcely

ever permitting them to be read by their own heroine, who, if she

accidentally take up a novel, is sure to turn over its insipid pages

with disgust. Alas! If the heroine of one novel be not patronized by the

heroine of another, from whom can she expect protection and regard? I

cannot approve of it. Let us leave it to the reviewers to abuse such

effusions of fancy at their leisure, and over every new novel to talk in

threadbare strains of the trash with which the press now groans. Let us

not desert one another; we are an injured body. Although our productions

have afforded more extensive and unaffected pleasure than those of any

other literary corporation in the world, no species of composition has

been so much decried. From pride, ignorance, or fashion, our foes

are almost as many as our readers. And while the abilities of the

nine-hundredth abridger of the History of England, or of the man who

collects and publishes in a volume some dozen lines of Milton, Pope, and

Prior, with a paper from the Spectator, and a chapter from Sterne,

are eulogized by a thousand pens—there seems almost a general wish of

decrying the capacity and undervaluing the labour of the novelist, and

of slighting the performances which have only genius, wit, and taste to

recommend them. ""I am no novel-reader—I seldom look into novels—Do not

imagine that I often read novels—It is really very well for a novel.""

Such is the common cant. ""And what are you reading, Miss—?"" ""Oh! It is

only a novel!"" replies the young lady, while she lays down her book

with affected indifference, or momentary shame. ""It is only Cecilia, or

Camilla, or Belinda""; or, in short, only some work in which the greatest

powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge

of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the

liveliest effusions of wit and humour, are conveyed to the world in the

best-chosen language. Now, had the same young lady been engaged with a

volume of the Spectator, instead of such a work, how proudly would she

have produced the book, and told its name; though the chances must be

against her being occupied by any part of that voluminous publication,

of which either the matter or manner would not disgust a young person of

taste: the substance of its papers so often consisting in the statement

of improbable circumstances, unnatural characters, and topics of

conversation which no longer concern anyone living; and their language,

too, frequently so coarse as to give no very favourable idea of the age

that could endure it."

Could it be possible, or did not her senses play her false? An inventory

of linen, in coarse and modern characters, seemed all that was before

her! If the evidence of sight might be trusted, she held a washing-bill

in her hand. She seized another sheet, and saw the same articles with

little variation; a third, a fourth, and a fifth presented nothing

new. Shirts, stockings, cravats, and waistcoats faced her in each. Two

others, penned by the same hand, marked an expenditure scarcely more

interesting, in letters, hair-powder, shoe-string, and breeches-ball.

And the larger sheet, which had enclosed the rest, seemed by its first

cramp line, ""To poultice chestnut mare""—a farrier's bill! Such was the

collection of papers (left perhaps, as she could then suppose, by the

negligence of a servant in the place whence she had taken them) which

had filled her with expectation and alarm, and robbed her of half her

night's rest! She felt humbled to the dust. Could not the adventure of

the chest have taught her wisdom? A corner of it, catching her eye as

she lay, seemed to rise up in judgment against her. Nothing could now

be clearer than the absurdity of her recent fancies. To suppose that a

manuscript of many generations back could have remained undiscovered in

a room such as that, so modern, so habitable!—Or that she should be the

first to possess the skill of unlocking a cabinet, the key of which was

open to all!"

it takes place in men and other animals. The analogical reasoning is much

machines, and even their most minute parts, are adjusted to each other
with an accuracy which ravishes into admiration all men who have ever
contemplated them. The curious adapting of means to ends, throughout all
nature, resembles exactly, though it much exceeds, the productions of
human contrivance; of human designs, thought, wisdom, and intelligence.
Since, therefore, the effects resemble each other, we are led to infer,
by all the rules of analogy, that the causes also resemble; and that the
Author of Nature is somewhat similar to the mind of man, though possessed
of much larger faculties, proportioned to the grandeur of the work which
he has executed. By this argument a posteriori, and by this argument

My guess is that, at the time, this argument would have been very convincing. It would be difficult to imagine a fully-formed eye coming without some design or designated creator. Now, however, there are many theories as to what intermediate forms produced the eye, or filled in the gaps in the fossil record. This argument is still relevant, as many questions remain unanswered about the gaps, but as someone raised in the twenty-first century, it is far easier for me to disagree with Cleanthes on the conclusion he draws from this evidence.  In fact, the functionality and precision of the eye is, in many ways, evidence that supports evolution.

In the end, animals are nothing but matter just like everything else and thereby follow the same rules of physics.  However, on a more philosophical note, I think the biggest flaw in Cleanthes' argument is that it limits god to merely being an entity to accredit everything we cannot understand to. BY our nature humans are always striving to learn more about our world and when we cannot find an answer it can be very frustrating. As in this example, the eye is one of the most complex parts of our anatomy and until recently humans had no idea how it worked. It is easy to conclude that God must have designed it and in a similar fashion we can easily state that anything we dont understand is attributable to God. THis is very dangerous. It makes god simply a placeholder and whenever we discover new information his size shrinks slightly. ","Consider, anatomise the eye;
survey its structure and contrivance; and tell me, from your own feeling,

with life. Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed? It 
was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a mystery; yet 
with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice 
or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries. I revolved these circumstances 
in my mind, and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to 
those branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology. Unless I had 
been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this study 
would have been irksome, and almost intolerable. To examine the causes of life, 
we must first have recourse to death. I became acquainted with the science of 
anatomy: but this was not sufficient; I must also observe the natural decay and 
corruption of the human body. In my education my father had taken the greatest 
precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do 
not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition, or to have feared 
the apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy; and a 
churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life, which, 
from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become food for the worm. Now I 
was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay, and forced to spend 
days and nights in vaults and charnel houses. My attention was fixed upon every 
object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. I saw how 
the fine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of death 
succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm inherited the wonders 
of the eye and brain. I paused, examining and analysing all the minutiae of 
causation, as exemplified in the change from life to death, and death to life, 
until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon me -- a light 
so brilliant and wondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the 
immensity of the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so 
many men of genius, who had directed their inquiries towards the same science, 
that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret."

Taking such a statement for granted sounds a little presumptuous, and also a convenient way for PHILO to segway in to the morally neutral argument.  2) PHILO never considers the energy and interplay and novel information brought on by the nature and progression of the human condition in the natural world as a tangible by-product from the perspective of a greater power.... he (and the rest of the crew) contemplate ideas centered around happiness, morality and the physicality of human life when discussing the motives of GOD. Any discussion of a purpose seems to fall out of concepts in this realm, which annoys me. I guess the idea of the universe and all it's inhabitants providing the computational fodder for a giant tabulating device was a little beyond the scope of existing technology.

first Christian who ventured openly to assert, that faith was nothing but
a species of reason; that religion was only a branch of philosophy; and
that a chain of arguments, similar to that which established any truth in
morals, politics, or physics, was always employed in discovering all the
principles of theology, natural and revealed. The ill use which BAYLE and
other libertines made of the philosophical scepticism of the fathers and
first reformers, still further propagated the judicious sentiment of Mr.
LOCKE: And it is now in a manner avowed, by all pretenders to reasoning
and philosophy, that Atheist and Sceptic are almost synonymous. And as it
is certain that no man is in earnest when he professes the latter
principle, I would fain hope that there are as few who seriously maintain
the former."

often able to outweigh a day, a week, a month of our common insipid
enjoyments; and how many days, weeks, and months, are passed by several
in the most acute torments? Pleasure, scarcely in one instance, is ever
able to reach ecstasy and rapture; and in no one instance can it continue
for any time at its highest pitch and altitude. The spirits evaporate,
the nerves relax, the fabric is disordered, and the enjoyment quickly
degenerates into fatigue and uneasiness. But pain often, good God, how
often! rises to torture and agony; and the longer it continues, it
becomes still more genuine agony and torture. Patience is exhausted,
courage languishes, melancholy seizes us, and nothing terminates our

economy of the animal creation, by which pains, as well as pleasures, are
employed to excite all creatures to action, and make them vigilant in the
great work of self-preservation. Now pleasure alone, in its various
degrees, seems to human understanding sufficient for this purpose. All
animals might be constantly in a state of enjoyment: but when urged by
any of the necessities of nature, such as thirst, hunger, weariness;
instead of pain, they might feel a diminution of pleasure, by which they
might be prompted to seek that object which is necessary to their
subsistence. Men pursue pleasure as eagerly as they avoid pain; at least
they might have been so constituted. It seems, therefore, plainly
possible to carry on the business of life without any pain. Why then is
any animal ever rendered susceptible of such a sensation? If animals can
be free from it an hour, they might enjoy a perpetual exemption from it;
and it required as particular a contrivance of their organs to produce
that feeling, as to endow them with sight, hearing, or any of the senses.
Shall we conjecture, that such a contrivance was necessary, without any
appearance of reason? and shall we build on that conjecture as on the
most certain truth?"

entirely destroy the creature. Wherever one power is increased, there is
a proportional abatement in the others. Animals which excel in swiftness
are commonly defective in force. Those which possess both are either
imperfect in some of their senses, or are oppressed with the most craving
wants. The human species, whose chief excellency is reason and sagacity,
is of all others the most necessitous, and the most deficient in bodily

he says may be strictly true: The alteration of one particular, while the
other parts of the building remain, may only augment the inconveniences.

skill and good intentions, he might have formed such a plan of the whole,

caught by the moving figure of a gigantic
black, emerging from the general crowd below,
and slowly advancing towards the elevated
poop. An iron collar was about his neck,
from which depended a chain, thrice wound
round his body; the terminating links padlocked
together at a broad band of iron, his girdle.

""How like a mute Atufal moves,"" murmured
the servant.

The black mounted the steps of the poop,
and, like a brave prisoner, brought up to receive
sentence, stood in unquailing muteness
before Don Benito, now recovered from his
attack."

by, the contrast in dress, denoting their
relative positions. The Spaniard wore a loose
Chili jacket of dark velvet; white small-clothes
and stockings, with silver buckles at the
knee and instep; a high-crowned sombrero, of
fine grass; a slender sword, silver mounted,
hung from a knot in his sash—the last being an
almost invariable adjunct, more for utility than
ornament, of a South American gentleman's
dress to this hour. Excepting when his occasional
nervous contortions brought about disarray,
there was a certain precision in his attire
curiously at variance with the unsightly disorder
around; especially in the belittered
Ghetto, forward of the main-mast, wholly occupied
by the blacks.

The servant wore nothing but wide trowsers,
apparently, from their coarseness and patches,
made out of some old topsail; they were clean,
and confined at the waist by a bit of unstranded
rope, which, with his composed, deprecatory

begging friar of St. Francis."

not have been particularly noticed, were it

eye fixed on Captain Delano, from whom, presently,
it passed, as if by a natural sequence, to

among the razors, as for the sharpest, and having

expertly strapping it on the firm, smooth, oily
skin of his open palm; he then made a gesture

suds on the Spaniard's lank neck. Not
unaffected by the close sight of the gleaming
steel, Don Benito nervously shuddered; his
usual ghastliness was heightened by the lather,

at least to Captain Delano, nor, as he saw the
two thus postured, could he resist the vagary,

the white a man at the block. But this was

strange feelings. Was man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and 
magnificent, yet so vicious and base? He appeared at one time a mere scion of 
the evil principle, and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and 
godlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can 
befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on record have been, 
appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more abject than that of the blind 
mole or harmless worm. For a long time I could not conceive how one man could go 
forth to murder his fellow, or even why there were laws and governments; but 
when I heard details of vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased, and I turned away 
with disgust and loathing.

""Every conversation of the cottagers now opened 
new wonders to me. While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed 
upon the Arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me. I 
heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty; of 
rank, descent, and noble blood.

""The words induced me to turn towards myself. I 
learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow-creatures were high 
and unsullied descent united with riches. A man might be respected with only one 
of these acquisitions; but, without either, he was considered, except in very rare 
instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profit 
of the chosen few! And what was I? Of my creation and creator I was absolutely 
ignorant; but I knew that I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. 
I was, besides, endowed with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not 
even of the same nature as men. I was more agile than they, and could subsist 
upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my 
frame; my stature far exceeded theirs. When I looked around, I saw and heard of 
none like me. Was I then a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men 
fled, and whom all men disowned?"

imperfect teeth: long-haired and coarse-haired animals are apt to have, as
is asserted, long or many horns; pigeons with feathered feet have skin

common camel, prevented their domestication? I cannot doubt that if other
animals and plants, equal in number to our domesticated productions, and

unite two forms together by others having intermediate characters, he
treats the one as a variety of the other, ranking the most common, but
sometimes the one first described, as the species, and the other as the
variety. But cases of great difficulty, which I will not here enumerate,

The same is true for organic organisms; either they compensate so that the population of each species is of a size that is small enough to be maintained by the available resources and large enough to continue as a species, or one species adapts to another niche or dies out, leaving the other to occupy the disputed niche.","As species of the same genus have usually, though by no means invariably,
some similarity in habits and constitution, and always in structure, the
struggle will generally be more severe between species of the same genus,
when they come into competition with each other, than between species of
distinct genera"

the case of a country undergoing some physical change, for instance, of
climate. The proportional numbers of its inhabitants would almost
immediately undergo a change, and some species might become extinct. We may
conclude, from what we have seen of the intimate and complex manner in

in the numerical proportions of some of the inhabitants, independently of

He pointed out that it is difficult to find graduations of an organ like eye in animals. I think this is where anti-evolution believers could have attacked the theory of evolution by pointing out the lack of graduations.   ","In looking for the gradations by which an organ in any species has been
perfected, we ought to look exclusively to its lineal ancestors; but this
is scarcely ever possible, and we are forced in each case to look to
species of the same group, that is to the collateral descendants from the
same original parent-form, in order to see what gradations are possible,
and for the chance of some gradations having been transmitted from the
earlier stages of descent, in an unaltered or little altered condition.
Amongst existing Vertebrata, we find but a small amount of gradation in the
structure of the eye, and from fossil species we can learn nothing on this
head. In this great class we should probably have to descend far beneath
the lowest known fossiliferous stratum to discover the earlier stages, by
which the eye has been perfected."

poor chance of leaving offspring. Sexual selection by always allowing the

if any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal

accumulated to a greater or lesser amount, thus causing a greater or lesser
amount of modification in the varying species, depends on many complex
contingencies,--on the variability being of a beneficial nature, on the
power of intercrossing, on the rate of breeding, on the slowly changing
physical conditions of the country, and more especially on the nature of
the other inhabitants with which the varying species comes into
competition"

plainly show that an early progenitor had the organ in a fully developed

modification in the descendants. Throughout whole classes various
structures are formed on the same pattern, and at an embryonic age the

This is interesting to contemplate because the way Shelley words her sentence, it appears as though she is trying to justify her incorporation of a multitude of ideas and texts into Frankenstein. I guess it could also be looked at in the way that she is recognizing the origins of the concepts in her novel by redefining the term ""Sanchean phrase"". Miguel Cervantes would most likely define the term in relation to Don Quixote, as simply speaking in parables like Sancho Panza. However, Shelley appears to be creating a new definition that goes beneath the surface of the narration by implying that Sancho didn't just say words that other people had said, he pulled ideas from the past in the form of the parables and applied them to his current situation in order to better convey his thoughts to Don Quixote. In a similar way, Shelley integrates different texts and ideas into her own novel that give readers a more clear understanding of what she is trying to convey and makes readers really contemplate the events that occur. But I digress. These observations are things that we have gone over in class and that would be obvious to most readers with a little knowledge on the subject. I think the real significance behind this reference to Don Quixote lies in the connections between the concepts embedded in each of the novels that the reference prompts us to explore.","Every thing must have a beginning, to speak in 
Sanchean phrase; and that beginning must be linked to something that went 
before."

principle of life, and whether there was any probability of its ever being 
discovered and communicated. They talked of the experiments of Dr. 
Darwin, (I speak not of what the Doctor really did, or said that he did, 
but, as more to my purpose, of what was then spoken of as having been done by 
him,) who preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case, till by some 
extraordinary means it 
began to move with voluntary motion. Not thus, after all, would life be 
given. Perhaps a corpse would be re-animated;
galvanism had given token of such things: perhaps the component parts of a 
creature might be manufactured, brought together, and endued with vital warmth."

This is very similar to Don Quixote's fanatic obsession with the chivalric novels that inspired him to become a knight. It is interesting to note that Shelley could have gotten her idea for setting the foundation of Frankenstein on literature, both references to it and learning from/getting motivated by it with the characters themselves straight from Don Quixote. After all, everything has a beginning.","""One night, during my accustomed visit to the 
neighbouring wood, where I collected my own food, and brought home firing for my 
protectors, I found on the ground a leathern portmanteau, containing several 
articles of dress and some books. I eagerly seized the prize, and returned with 
it to my hovel. Fortunately the books were written in the language the elements 
of which I had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of Paradise Lost, a 
volume of Plutarch's Lives, and the Sorrows of Werter. The possession of these 
treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually studied and exercised my 
mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary 
occupations.

""I can hardly describe to you the effect of these 
books. They produced in me an infinity of new images and feelings that sometimes 
raised me to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In 
the Sorrows of Werter, besides the interest of its simple and affecting story, 
so many opinions are canvassed, and so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto 
been to me obscure subjects, that I found in it a never-ending source of 
speculation and astonishment. The gentle and domestic manners it described, 
combined with lofty sentiments and feelings, which had for their object 
something out of self, accorded well with my experience among my protectors, and 
with the wants which were for ever alive in my own bosom. But I thought Werter 
himself a more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character 
contained no pretension, but it sunk deep. The disquisitions upon death and 
suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder. I did not pretend to enter into 
the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards the opinions of the hero, whose 
extinction I wept, without precisely understanding it.

""As I read, however, I applied much personally to 
my own feelings and condition. I found myself similar, yet at the same time 
strangely unlike to the beings concerning whom I read, and to whose conversation 
I was a listener. I sympathised with, and partly understood them, but I was 
unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none. 'The path of my 
departure was free'; and there was none to lament my annihilation. My person was 
hideous and my stature gigantic. What did this mean? Who was I? What was I? 
Whence did I come? What was my destination? These questions continually 
recurred, but I was unable to solve them.

""The volume of Plutarch's Lives which I 
possessed, contained the histories of the first founders of the ancient 
republics. This book had a far different effect upon me from the Sorrows of Werter. I learned from Werter's imaginations despondency and gloom: but Plutarch 
taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own 
reflections to admire and love the heroes of past ages. Many things I read 
surpassed my understanding and experience. I had a very confused knowledge of 
kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers, and boundless seas. But I was 
perfectly unacquainted with towns, and large assemblages of men. The cottage of 
my protectors had been the only school in which I had studied human nature; but 
this book developed new and mightier scenes of action. I read of men concerned 
in public affairs, governing or massacring their species. I felt the greatest 
ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as far as I 
understood the signification of those terms, relative as they were, as I applied 
them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these feelings, I was of course led 
to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa, Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to 
Romulus and Theseus. The patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these 
impressions to take a firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to 
humanity had been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I 
should have been imbued with different sensations.

""But Paradise Lost excited different and far 
deeper emotions. I read it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen 
into my hands, as a true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that 
the picture of an omnipotent Go warring with his creatures was capable of 
exciting. I often referred the several situations, as their similarity struck 
me, to my own. Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to any other being 
in existence; but his state was far different from mine in every other respect. 
He had come forth from the hands of God a perfect creature, happy and 
prosperous, guarded by the especial care of his Creator; he was allowed to 
converse with, and acquire knowledge from, beings of a superior nature: but I 
was wretched, helpless, and alone. Many times I considered Satan as the fitter 
emblem of my condition; for often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my 
protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me."

the inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In

Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it with apathy; the theory which he attempts to 
demonstrate, and the wonderful facts which he relates, soon changed this feeling 
into enthusiasm. A new light seemed to dawn upon my mind; and, bounding with 
joy, I communicated my discovery to my
father. 
I cannot help remarking here the many opportunities instructors possess of 
directing the attention of their pupils to useful knowledge, which they utterly 
neglect. My father looked carelessly at the title-page of my book, and said, 
""Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do not waste your time upon this; it is 
sad trash."""

of different species, is sometimes inherited and sometimes not so; why the child often reverts in certain characters to its grandfather or grandmother or other
much more remote ancestor; why a peculiarity is often transmitted from one sex to both sexes or to one sex alone, more commonly but not exclusively to the like
sex. It is a fact of some little importance to us, that peculiarities appearing in the males of our domestic breeds are often transmitted either exclusively,
or in a much greater degree, to males alone. A much more important rule, which I think may be trusted, is that, at whatever period of life a peculiarity first
appears, it tends to appear in the offspring at a corresponding age, though sometimes earlier. In many cases this could not be otherwise: thus the inherited
peculiarities in the horns of cattle could appear only in the offspring when nearly mature; peculiarities in the silkworm are known to appear at the
corresponding caterpillar or cocoon stage. But hereditary diseases and some other facts make me believe that the rule has a wider extension, and that when
there is no apparent reason why a peculiarity should appear at any particular age, yet that it does tend to appear in the offspring at the same period at which
it first appeared in the parent. I believe this rule to be of the highest importance in explaining the laws of embryology. These remarks are of course confined
to the first APPEARANCE of the peculiarity, and not to its primary cause, which may have acted on the ovules or male element; in nearly the same manner as in
the crossed offspring from a short-horned cow by a long-horned bull, the greater length of horn, though appearing late in life, is clearly due to the male
element."

When domesticated animals are placed back in to the wild, they will very quickly revert to their feral forms or die","Having alluded to the subject of reversion, I may here refer to a statement often made by naturalists—namely, that our domestic varieties, when run
wild, gradually but certainly revert in character to their aboriginal stocks. Hence it has been argued that no deductions can be drawn from domestic races to
species in a state of nature. I have in vain endeavoured to discover on what decisive facts the above statement has so often and so boldly been made. There
would be great difficulty in proving its truth: we may safely conclude that very many of the most strongly-marked domestic varieties could not possibly live in
a wild state. In many cases we do not know what the aboriginal stock was, and so could not tell whether or not nearly perfect reversion had ensued. It would be
quite necessary, in order to prevent the effects of intercrossing, that only a single variety should be turned loose in its new home. Nevertheless, as our
varieties certainly do occasionally revert in some of their characters to ancestral forms, it seems to me not improbable, that if we could succeed in
naturalising, or were to cultivate, during many generations, the several races, for instance, of the cabbage, in very poor soil (in which case, however, some
effect would have to be attributed to the direct action of the poor soil), that they would to a large extent, or even wholly, revert to the wild aboriginal
stock. Whether or not the experiment would succeed, is not of great importance for our line of argument; for by the experiment itself the conditions of life
are changed. If it could be shown that our domestic varieties manifested a strong tendency to reversion,—that is, to lose their acquired characters,
whilst kept under unchanged conditions, and whilst kept in a considerable body, so that free intercrossing might check, by blending together, any slight
deviations of structure, in such case, I grant that we could deduce nothing from domestic varieties in regard to species. But there is not a shadow of evidence
in favour of this view: to assert that we could not breed our cart and race-horses, long and short-horned cattle, and poultry of various breeds, and esculent
vegetables, for an almost infinite number of generations, would be opposed to all experience. I may add, that when under nature the conditions of life do
change, variations and reversions of character probably do occur; but natural selection, as will hereafter be explained, will determine how far the new
characters thus arising shall be preserved."

A domestic animal can do whatever it wants and survive, wheres as a wild animal has to follow very strict guidelines in order to do so. e.g. very specific ways lions hunt, otherwise they wouldn't be able to get enough food to survive","When we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants, and compare them with species closely allied together, we generally
perceive in each domestic race, as already remarked, less uniformity of character than in true species. Domestic races of the same species, also, often have a
somewhat monstrous character; by which I mean, that, although differing from each other, and from the other species of the same genus, in several trifling
respects, they often differ in an extreme degree in some one part, both when compared one with another, and more especially when compared with all the species
in nature to which they are nearest allied."

individuals of distinct species, or with the physical conditions of life. It is the doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and
vegetable kingdoms; for in this case there can be no artificial increase of food, and no prudential restraint from marriage. Although some species may be now
increasing, more or less rapidly, in numbers, all cannot do so, for the world would not hold them."

the progeny of a single pair. Even slow-breeding man has doubled in twenty-five years, and at this rate, in a few thousand years, there would literally not be
standing room for his progeny. Linnaeus has calculated that if an annual plant produced only two seeds—and there is no plant so unproductive as
this—and their seedlings next year produced two, and so on, then in twenty years there would be a million plants. The elephant is reckoned to be the
slowest breeder of all known animals, and I have taken some pains to estimate its probable minimum rate of natural increase: it will be under the mark to
assume that it breeds when thirty years old, and goes on breeding till ninety years old, bringing forth three pair of young in this interval; if this be so, at
the end of the fifth century there would be alive fifteen million elephants, descended from the first pair."

depend on a rapidly fluctuating amount of food, for it allows them rapidly to increase in number. But the real importance of a large number of eggs or seeds is
to make up for much destruction at some period of life; and this period in the great majority of cases is an early one. If an animal can in any way protect its
own eggs or young, a small number may be produced, and yet the average stock be fully kept up; but if many eggs or young are destroyed, many must be produced,
or the species will become extinct. It would suffice to keep up the full number of a tree, which lived on an average for a thousand years, if a single seed
were produced once in a thousand years, supposing that this seed were never destroyed, and could be ensured to germinate in a fitting place. So that in all
cases, the average number of any animal or plant depends only indirectly on the number of its eggs or seeds."

most effective of all checks. I estimated that the winter of 1854-55 destroyed four-fifths of the birds in my own grounds; and this is a tremendous
destruction, when we remember that ten per cent. is an extraordinarily severe mortality from epidemics with man. The action of climate seems at first sight to
be quite independent of the struggle for existence; but in so far as climate chiefly acts in reducing food, it brings on the most severe struggle between the

possibly survive) that individuals having any advantage, however slight, over others, would have the best chance of surviving and of procreating their kind? On
the other hand, we may feel sure that any variation in the least degree injurious would be rigidly destroyed. This preservation of favourable variations and
the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection. Variations neither useful nor injurious would not be affected by natural selection, and would
be left a fluctuating element, as perhaps we see in the species called polymorphic."

what we have seen of the intimate and complex manner in which the inhabitants of each country are bound together, that any change in the numerical proportions
of some of the inhabitants, independently of the change of climate itself, would most seriously affect many of the others. If the country were open on its
borders, new forms would certainly immigrate, and this also would seriously disturb the relations of some of the former inhabitants. Let it be remembered how
powerful the influence of a single introduced tree or mammal has been shown to be. But in the case of an island, or of a country partly surrounded by barriers,
into which new and better adapted forms could not freely enter, we should then have places in the economy of nature which would assuredly be better filled up,
if some of the original inhabitants were in some manner modified; for, had the area been open to immigration, these same places would have been seized on by
intruders. In such case, every slight modification, which in the course of ages chanced to arise, and which in any way favoured the individuals of any of the
species, by better adapting them to their altered conditions, would tend to be preserved; and natural selection would thus have free scope for the work of
improvement."

The rarer a species is, the less it reproduces, and the less it will adapt, leading to it eventually being beaten out of survival in that environment. Rarity of a species is a sign that it is on its way out of existence","But as from the high geometrical powers of increase of all organic beings, each
area is already fully stocked with inhabitants, it follows that as each selected and favoured form increases in number, so will the less favoured forms
decrease and become rare. Rarity, as geology tells us, is the precursor to extinction. We can, also, see that any form represented by few individuals will,
during fluctuations in the seasons or in the number of its enemies, run a good chance of utter extinction. But we may go further than this; for as new forms
are continually and slowly being produced, unless we believe that the number of specific forms goes on perpetually and almost indefinitely increasing, numbers
inevitably must become extinct. That the number of specific forms has not indefinitely increased, geology shows us plainly; and indeed we can see reason why
they should not have thus increased, for the number of places in the polity of nature is not indefinitely great,—not that we have any means of knowing
that any one region has as yet got its maximum of species. Probably no region is as yet fully stocked, for at the Cape of Good Hope, where more species of
plants are crowded together than in any other quarter of the world, some foreign plants have become naturalised, without causing, as far as we know, the
extinction of any natives. 

 Furthermore, the species which are most numerous in individuals will have the best chance of producing within any given period favourable variations. We
have evidence of this, in the facts given in the second chapter, showing that it is the common species which afford the greatest number of recorded varieties,
or incipient species. Hence, rare species will be less quickly modified or improved within any given period, and they will consequently be beaten in the race
for life by the modified descendants of the commoner species."

This is what Darwin thought, but we now know that acquired traits are not passed on genetically and this would not actually happen","From the facts alluded to in
the first chapter, I think there can be little doubt that use in our domestic animals strengthens and enlarges certain parts, and disuse diminishes them; and
that such modifications are inherited. Under free nature, we can have no standard of comparison, by which to judge of the effects of long-continued use or
disuse, for we know not the parent-forms; but many animals have structures which can be explained by the effects of disuse. As Professor Owen has remarked,
there is no greater anomaly in nature than a bird that cannot fly; yet there are several in this state. The logger-headed duck of South America can only flap
along the surface of the water, and has its wings in nearly the same condition as the domestic Aylesbury duck. As the larger ground-feeding birds seldom take
flight except to escape danger, I believe that the nearly wingless condition of several birds, which now inhabit or have lately inhabited several oceanic
islands, tenanted by no beast of prey, has been caused by disuse. The ostrich indeed inhabits continents and is exposed to danger from which it cannot escape
by flight, but by kicking it can defend itself from enemies, as well as any of the smaller quadrupeds. We may imagine that the early progenitor of the ostrich
had habits like those of a bustard, and that as natural selection increased in successive generations the size and weight of its body, its legs were used more,
and its wings less, until they became incapable of flight."

It worked out that the smaller, covered up eyes got infected less so the version with that mutation survived better and pushed out the versions with larger eyes -- natural selection","The eyes of moles and of some burrowing rodents are rudimentary in size, and in some cases are quite covered up by skin and fur. This state of the eyes is
probably due to gradual reduction from disuse, but aided perhaps by natural selection. In South America, a burrowing rodent, the tuco-tuco, or Ctenomys, is
even more subterranean in its habits than the mole; and I was assured by a Spaniard, who had often caught them, that they were frequently blind; one which I
kept alive was certainly in this condition, the cause, as appeared on dissection, having been inflammation of the nictitating membrane. As frequent
inflammation of the eyes must be injurious to any animal, and as eyes are certainly not indispensable to animals with subterranean habits, a reduction in their
size with the adhesion of the eyelids and growth of fur over them, might in such case be an advantage; and if so, natural selection would constantly aid the
effects of disuse."

the crabs the foot-stalk for the eye remains, though the eye is gone; the stand for the telescope is there, though the telescope with its glasses has been
lost. As it is difficult to imagine that eyes, though useless, could be in any way injurious to animals living in darkness, I attribute their loss wholly to
disuse. In one of the blind animals, namely, the cave-rat, the eyes are of immense size; and Professor Silliman thought that it regained, after living some
days in the light, some slight power of vision. In the same manner as in Madeira the wings of some of the insects have been enlarged, and the wings of others
have been reduced by natural selection aided by use and disuse, so in the case of the cave-rat natural selection seems to have struggled with the loss of light
and to have increased the size of the eyes; whereas with all the other inhabitants of the caves, disuse by itself seems to have done its work."

The parent and transitional varities have gone extinct, yet we have no fossils. This is due more to a lack in geological record than that these intermediate varieties may not have existed at all","As natural selection acts solely by the preservation of profitable modifications, each new form will tend in a fully-stocked country
to take the place of, and finally to exterminate, its own less improved parent or other less-favoured forms with which it comes into competition. Thus
extinction and natural selection will, as we have seen, go hand in hand. Hence, if we look at each species as descended from some other unknown form, both the
parent and all the transitional varieties will generally have been exterminated by the very process of formation and perfection of the new form. 

 But, as by this theory innumerable transitional forms must have existed, why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of the earth?
It will be much more convenient to discuss this question in the chapter on the Imperfection of the geological record; and I will here only state that I believe
the answer mainly lies in the record being incomparably less perfect than is generally supposed; the imperfection of the record being chiefly due to organic
beings not inhabiting profound depths of the sea, and to their remains being embedded and preserved to a future age only in masses of sediment sufficiently
thick and extensive to withstand an enormous amount of future degradation; and such fossiliferous masses can be accumulated only where much sediment is
deposited on the shallow bed of the sea, whilst it slowly subsides. These contingencies will concur only rarely, and after enormously long intervals. Whilst
the bed of the sea is stationary or is rising, or when very little sediment is being deposited, there will be blanks in our geological history. The crust of
the earth is a vast museum; but the natural collections have been made only at intervals of time immensely remote."

intermediate links: firstly, because new varieties are very slowly formed, for variation is a very slow process, and natural selection can do nothing until
favourable variations chance to occur, and until a place in the natural polity of the country can be better filled by some modification of some one or more of
its inhabitants. And such new places will depend on slow changes of climate, or on the occasional immigration of new inhabitants, and, probably, in a still
more important degree, on some of the old inhabitants becoming slowly modified, with the new forms thus produced and the old ones acting and reacting on each
other. So that, in any one region and at any one time, we ought only to see a few species presenting slight modifications of structure in some degree
permanent; and this assuredly we do see."

first have been formed in the intermediate zones, but they will generally have had a short duration. For these intermediate varieties will, from reasons
already assigned (namely from what we know of the actual distribution of closely allied or representative species, and likewise of acknowledged varieties),
exist in the intermediate zones in lesser numbers than the varieties which they tend to connect. From this cause alone the intermediate varieties will be
liable to accidental extermination; and during the process of further modification through natural selection, they will almost certainly be beaten and
supplanted by the forms which they connect; for these from existing in greater numbers will, in the aggregate, present more variation, and thus be further
improved through natural selection and gain further advantages."

intermediate varieties between the several representative species and their common parent, must formerly have existed in each broken portion of the land, but
these links will have been supplanted and exterminated during the process of natural selection, so that they will no longer exist in a living state."

habits; for how could the animal in its transitional state have subsisted? It would be easy to show that within the same group carnivorous animals exist having
every intermediate grade between truly aquatic and strictly terrestrial habits; and as each exists by a struggle for life, it is clear that each is well
adapted in its habits to its place in nature. Look at the Mustela vison of North America, which has webbed feet and which resembles an otter in its fur, short
legs, and form of tail; during summer this animal dives for and preys on fish, but during the long winter it leaves the frozen waters, and preys like other
polecats on mice and land animals. If a different case had been taken, and it had been asked how an insectivorous quadruped could possibly have been converted
into a flying bat, the question would have been far more difficult, and I could have given no answer. Yet I think such difficulties have very little weight."

admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I
freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree. Yet reason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect
and simple, each grade being useful to its possessor, can be shown to exist; if further, the eye does vary ever so slightly, and the variations be inherited,
which is certainly the case; and if any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal under changing conditions of life, then the
difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by our imagination, can hardly be considered
real. How a nerve comes to be sensitive to light, hardly concerns us more than how life itself first originated; but I may remark that several facts make me
suspect that any sensitive nerve may be rendered sensitive to light, and likewise to those coarser vibrations of the air which produce sound."

highest human intellects; and we naturally infer that the eye has been formed by a somewhat analogous process. But may not this inference be presumptuous? Have
we any right to assume that the Creator works by intellectual powers like those of man? If we must compare the eye to an optical instrument, we ought in
imagination to take a thick layer of transparent tissue, with a nerve sensitive to light beneath, and then suppose every part of this layer to be continually
changing slowly in density, so as to separate into layers of different densities and thicknesses, placed at different distances from each other, and with the
surfaces of each layer slowly changing in form. Further we must suppose that there is a power always intently watching each slight accidental alteration in the
transparent layers; and carefully selecting each alteration which, under varied circumstances, may in any way, or in any degree, tend to produce a distincter
image. We must suppose each new state of the instrument to be multiplied by the million; and each to be preserved till a better be produced, and then the old
ones to be destroyed. In living bodies, variation will cause the slight alterations, generation will multiply them almost infinitely, and natural selection
will pick out with unerring skill each improvement. Let this process go on for millions on millions of years; and during each year on millions of individuals
of many kinds; and may we not believe that a living optical instrument might thus be formed as superior to one of glass, as the works of the Creator are to
those of man?"

all the members of a large class, for in this latter case the organ must have been first formed at an extremely remote period, since which all the many members
of the class have been developed; and in order to discover the early transitional grades through which the organ has passed, we should have to look to very

Numerous cases could be
given amongst the lower animals of the same organ performing at the same time wholly distinct functions; thus the alimentary canal respires, digests, and
excretes in the larva of the dragon-fly and in the fish Cobites. In the Hydra, the animal may be turned inside out, and the exterior surface will then digest
and the stomach respire. In such cases natural selection might easily specialise, if any advantage were thus gained, a part or organ, which had performed two
functions, for one function alone, and thus wholly change its nature by insensible steps. Two distinct organs sometimes perform simultaneously the same
function in the same individual; to give one instance, there are fish with gills or branchiae that breathe the air dissolved in the water, at the same time
that they breathe free air in their swimbladders, this latter organ having a ductus pneumaticus for its supply, and being divided by highly vascular
partitions. In these cases, one of the two organs might with ease be modified and perfected so as to perform all the work by itself, being aided during the
process of modification by the other organ; and then this other organ might be modified for some other and quite distinct purpose, or be quite obliterated."

use for many purposes in so many land animals, which in their lungs or modified swim-bladders betray their aquatic origin, may perhaps be thus accounted for. A
well-developed tail having been formed in an aquatic animal, it might subsequently come to be worked in for all sorts of purposes, as a fly-flapper, an organ

at Gateshead Hall rendered it necessary to turn to account all 
the accommodation it contained: yet it was one of the largest and
stateliest chambers in the mansion.  A bed supported on 
massive pillars of mahogany, hung with curtains of deep red 
damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre; the two large 
windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half shrouded 
in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red; the
table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; 
the walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the
wardrobe, the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished 
old mahogany.  Out of these deep surrounding shades rose 
high, and glared white, the piled-up mattresses and pillows of 
the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles counterpane.  
Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair near 
the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool before it; and 
looking, as I thought, like a pale throne"

indifferently, looking straight before him.
“No, you men never do consider economy and common

the longer I considered the position, education, &c., of the 
parties, the less I felt justified in judging and blaming either 
him or Miss Ingram for acting in conformity to ideas and

childhood.  All their class held these principles: I 
supposed, then, they had reasons for holding them such as I could
not fathom.  It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like 
him, I would take to my bosom only such a wife as I could love;

at his ineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the
man: profoundly esteem the one, and freely forgive the 
other.  I should suffer often, no doubt, attached to him 
only in this capacity: my body would be under rather a stringent 
yoke, but my heart and mind would be free.  I should still 
have my unblighted self to turn to: my natural unenslaved 
feelings with which to communicate in moments of 
loneliness.  There would be recesses in my mind which would 
be only mine, to which he never came, and sentiments growing 
there fresh and sheltered which his austerity could never blight,
nor his measured warrior-march trample down: but as his 
wife—at his side always, and always restrained, and always 
checked—forced to keep the fire of my nature continually 
low, to compel it to burn inwardly and never utter a cry, though 
the imprisoned flame consumed vital after vital—this
would be unendurable."

live entirely for and with what I love best on earth.  I 
hold myself supremely blest—blest beyond what language can 
express; because I am my husband’s life as fully as he is 
mine.  No woman was ever nearer to her mate than I am: ever 
more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh.  I 
know no weariness of my Edward’s society: he knows none of 
mine, any more than we each do of the pulsation of the heart that
beats in our separate bosoms; consequently, we are ever 
together.  To be together is for us to be at once as free as
in solitude, as gay as in company.  We talk, I believe, all 
day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated and an 
audible thinking.  All my confidence is bestowed on him, all
his confidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in 
character—perfect concord is the result.
Mr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our 
union; perhaps it was that circumstance that drew us so very 
near—that knit us so very close: for I was then his vision,
as I am still his right hand.  Literally, I was (what he 
often called me) the apple of his eye.  He saw 
nature—he saw books through me; and never did I weary of 
gazing for his behalf, and of putting into words the effect of 
field, tree, town, river, cloud, sunbeam—of the landscape 
before us; of the weather round us—and impressing by sound 
on his ear what light could no longer stamp on his eye.  
Never did I weary of reading to him; never did I weary of 
conducting him where he wished to go: of doing for him what he 
wished to be done.  And there was a pleasure in my services,
most full, most exquisite, even though sad—because he 
claimed these services without painful shame or damping 
humiliation.  He loved me so truly, that he knew no 
reluctance in profiting by my attendance: he felt I loved him so 
fondly, that to yield that attendance was to indulge my sweetest 
wishes.
One morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing a 
letter to his dictation, he came and bent over me, and 
said—“Jane, have you a glittering ornament round your
neck?”
I had a gold watch-chain: I answered “Yes.”
“And have you a pale blue dress on?”




I had.  He informed me then, that for some time he had 
fancied the obscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense; 
and that now he was sure of it.
He and I went up to London.  He had the advice of an 
eminent oculist; and he eventually recovered the sight of that 
one eye.  He cannot now see very distinctly: he cannot read 
or write much; but he can find his way without being led by the 
hand: the sky is no longer a blank to him—the earth no 
longer a void.  When his first-born was put into his arms, 
he could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes, as they 
once were—large, brilliant, and black.  On that 
occasion, he again, with a full heart, acknowledged that God had 
tempered judgment with mercy.
My Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because 
those we most love are happy likewise.  Diana and Mary 
Rivers are both married: alternately, once every year, they come 
to see us, and we go to see them.  Diana’s husband is 
a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a good man.  
Mary’s is a clergyman, a college friend of her 
brother’s, and, from his attainments and principles, worthy
of the connection.  Both Captain Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton 
love their wives, and are loved by them.
As to St. John Rivers, he left England: he went to 
India.  He entered on the path he had marked for himself; he
pursues it still.  A more resolute, indefatigable pioneer 
never wrought amidst rocks and dangers.  Firm, faithful, and
devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he labours for his 
race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he hews down 
like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber 
it.  He may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be 
ambitious yet; but his is the sternness of the warrior 
Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from the onslaught of 
Apollyon.  His is the exaction of the apostle, who speaks 
but for Christ, when he says—“Whosoever will come 
after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow 
me.”  His is the ambition of the high master-spirit, 
which aims to fill a place in the first rank of those who are 
redeemed from the earth—who stand without fault before the 
throne of God, who share the last mighty victories of the Lamb, 
who are called, and chosen, and faithful.
St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now.  Himself 
has hitherto sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its 
close: his glorious sun hastens to its setting.  The last 
letter I received from him drew from my eyes human tears, and yet
filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated his sure reward, 
his incorruptible crown.  I know that a stranger’s 
hand will write to me next, to say that the good and faithful 
servant has been called at length into the joy of his Lord. 
And why weep for this?  No fear of death will darken St. 
John’s last hour: his mind will be unclouded, his heart 
will be undaunted, his hope will be sure, his faith 
steadfast.  His own words are a pledge of this—
“My Master,” he says, “has forewarned 
me.  Daily He announces more distinctly,—‘Surely
I come quickly!’ and hourly I more eagerly 
respond,—‘Amen; even so come, Lord 
Jesus!’”"

get into a wax when the boys were idle because that made them study

better or was he only letting on to be in a wax? It was because he was

allowed, because a priest would know what a sin was and would not do

it. But if he did it one time by mistake what would he do to go to

confession? Perhaps he would go to confession to the minister. And if

the minister did it he would go to the rector: and the rector to the

provincial: and the provincial to the general of the jesuits. That was

called the order: and he had heard his father say that they were all

clever men. They could all have become high-up people in the world if

they had not become jesuits. And he wondered what Father Arnall and

Paddy Barrett would have become and what Mr McGlade and Mr Gleeson

would have become if they had not become jesuits. It was hard to think

what because you would have to think of them in a different way with

different coloured coats and trousers and with beards and moustaches

and different kinds of hats."

tingling blow like the loud crack of a broken stick made his trembling

hand crumple together like a leaf in the fire: and at the sound and the

pain scalding tears were driven into his eyes. His whole body was shaking

with fright, his arm was shaking and his crumpled burning livid hand shook

like a loose leaf in the air. A cry sprang to his lips, a prayer to be let

off. But though the tears scalded his eyes and his limbs quivered with

pain and fright he held back the hot tears and the cry that scalded his

throat.

unrest crept into his blood. Sometimes a fever gathered within him and

led him to rove alone in the evening along the quiet avenue. The peace

of the gardens and the kindly lights in the windows poured a tender

influence into his restless heart. The noise of children at play

annoyed him and their silly voices made him feel, even more keenly than

he had felt at Clongowes, that he was different from others. He did not

want to play. He wanted to meet in the real world the unsubstantial

image which his soul so constantly beheld. He did not know where to

seek it or how, but a premonition which led him on told him that this

image would, without any overt act of his, encounter him. They would

meet quietly as if they had known each other and had made their tryst,

perhaps at one of the gates or in some more secret place. They would be

alone, surrounded by darkness and silence: and in that moment of

supreme tenderness he would be transfigured.







He would fade into something impalpable under her eyes and then in a

moment he would be transfigured. Weakness and timidity and inexperience

would fall from him in that magic moment."

all the members of a large class, for in this latter case the organ must have been first formed at an extremely remote period, since which all the many members

It should be noted that a likely reason for the omission of that detail is to preserve the stark contrast between the situation upon the Spanish ship and that of Delano's ship.

Melville's work of fiction is just that: a work of fiction. It's trying to look at themes and motifs in a simulated environment. Jonathan Barney is just another variable in the experiment, and with him, the story would lose some of its potency. The tension is created by knowing that Delano is aboard a ship whose captain has been taken hostage. We learn this before Delano does, and by knowing that only Delano is not privy to this simplifies the scenario and keeps us on track with the characters we're supposed to be focusing on. If Jonathan was a relevant character in the novel, we''d have that sense of solitude shattered. ","Massachusetts,"

and often as he knelt among the few worshippers at the side-altar,

following with his interleaved prayer-book the murmur of the priest, he

glanced up for an instant towards the vested figure standing in the

gloom between the two candles, which were the old and the new

testaments, and imagined that he was kneeling at mass in the catacombs.







His daily life was laid out in devotional areas. By means of

ejaculations and prayers he stored up ungrudgingly for the souls in

purgatory centuries of days and quarantines and years; yet the

spiritual triumph which he felt in achieving with ease so many fabulous

ages of canonical penances did not wholly reward his zeal of prayer,

since he could never know how much temporal punishment he had remitted

by way of suffrage for the agonizing souls; and fearful lest in the

midst of the purgatorial fire, which differed from the infernal only in

that it was not everlasting, his penance might avail no more than a

drop of moisture, he drove his soul daily through an increasing circle

of works of supererogation."

India.  He entered on the path he had marked for himself; he
pursues it still.  A more resolute, indefatigable pioneer 
never wrought amidst rocks and dangers.  Firm, faithful, and
devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he labours for his 
race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he hews down 
like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber 
it.  He may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be 
ambitious yet; but his is the sternness of the warrior 
Greatheart, who guards his pilgrim convoy from the onslaught of 
Apollyon.  His is the exaction of the apostle, who speaks 
but for Christ, when he says—“Whosoever will come 
after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow 
me.”  His is the ambition of the high master-spirit, 
which aims to fill a place in the first rank of those who are 
redeemed from the earth—who stand without fault before the 
throne of God, who share the last mighty victories of the Lamb, 
who are called, and chosen, and faithful.
St. John is unmarried: he never will marry now.  Himself 
has hitherto sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its 
close: his glorious sun hastens to its setting.  The last 
letter I received from him drew from my eyes human tears, and yet
filled my heart with divine joy: he anticipated his sure reward, 
his incorruptible crown.  I know that a stranger’s 
hand will write to me next, to say that the good and faithful 
servant has been called at length into the joy of his Lord. 
And why weep for this?  No fear of death will darken St. 
John’s last hour: his mind will be unclouded, his heart 
will be undaunted, his hope will be sure, his faith 
steadfast.  His own words are a pledge of this—
“My Master,” he says, “has forewarned 
me.  Daily He announces more distinctly,—‘Surely
I come quickly!’ and hourly I more eagerly 
respond,—‘Amen; even so come, Lord 
Jesus!’”"

Leur substance est immatérielle, l’interaction se limite à de l’information, excluant de fait trois des cinq sens, mais ces relations n’en sont pas moins réelles et elles occupent une place croissante de l’existence, des représentations et de l’identité des individus contemporains.

a thumbed missal on it, and over it a small,
meagre crucifix attached to the bulk-head. Under
the table lay a dented cutlass or two, with
a hacked harpoon, among some; melancholy
old rigging, like a heap of poor friars' girdles.
There were also two long, sharp-ribbed settees

of Malacca cane, black with age, and uncomfortable
to look at as inquisitors' racks, with a
large, misshapen arm-chair, which, furnished
with a rude barber's crotch at the back, working
with a screw, seemed some grotesque engine
of torment. A flag locker was in one corner,
open, exposing various colored bunting, some
rolled up, others half unrolled, still others tumbled.
Opposite was a cumbrous washstand, of
black mahogany, all of one block, with a pedestal,
like a font, and over it a railed shelf,
containing combs, brushes, and other implements
of the toilet. A torn hammock of stained
grass swung near; the sheets tossed, and
the pillow wrinkled up like a brow, as if who
ever slept here slept but illy, with alternate
visitations of sad thoughts and bad dreams.

The further extremity of the cuddy, overhanging
the ship's stern, was pierced with three
openings, windows or port-holes, according as
men or cannon might peer, socially or unsocially,
out of them. At present neither men nor
cannon were seen, though huge ring-bolts and
other rusty iron fixtures of the wood-work hinted
